- Comprehensive form validation for both types

### 3. URL Extraction Feature
- Auto-extraction from URLs for both products and services
- Dynamic extraction button text based on type
- Preview functionality with type-specific labels

- Timer functionality
- Featured item toggles

### 5. Gender Integration

### 6. State Management
- Comprehensive state management for all form fields

## Technical Implementation

### State Variables Added
```typescript
const [activeProductTab, setActiveProductTab] = useState<'products' | 'services'>('products');
const [manualProduct, setManualProduct] = useState({
  // Enhanced with service-specific fields
  isService: false,
  pricingType: 'one-time',
  monthlyPrice: '',
  yearlyPrice: '',
  isFree: false,
  priceDescription: ''
});
```

### Key Functions
- `extractProductDetails()`: Enhanced for both products and services
- `addExtractedProduct()`: Handles both types with proper API calls
- `addManualProduct()`: Comprehensive validation and submission
- `normalizeGender()`: Ensures consistent gender formatting

### UI Components
- Product/Service toggle buttons with icons
- Dynamic form labels and placeholders
- Type-specific validation messages
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Integration with Backend
- Uses existing `/api/admin/products` endpoint
- Proper `isService` flag setting
- Compatible with existing product schema
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Gender Filtering
- Works seamlessly with existing gender filtering
- Proper integration with GenderSwitchTabs component
- Category-specific gender options
- URL parameter handling for gender state

## Benefits
1. **Unified Interface**: Admins can add both products and services from any category
2. **Consistent UX**: Same interface patterns as main admin panel
3. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing throughout
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation for both types
5. **Flexibility**: Supports all existing features (timers, custom fields, etc.)

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/category.tsx`: Complete implementation with toggle functionality

## Usage
1. Admin logs into the system
2. Navigates to any category page
3. Clicks "Add Product" button (visible only to admins)
4. Selects either "Product" or "Service" tab
5. Uses URL extraction or manual entry
6. Submits the form to add the item to the category

## Future Enhancements
- Service-specific pricing models (subscription, freemium, etc.)
- Advanced service categorization
- Service-specific custom fields templates
- Integration with service management APIs

This implementation provides a complete solution for adding both products and services directly from category pages while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring proper gender filtering and categorization.
