I have fixed this by removing the invalid nested block and ensuring all here-documents are properly closed with matching delimiters.

The corrected script now:

- Tests SSH connection to your EC2 instance
- Clones your GitHub repository on EC2
- Installs dependencies (Node.js, Git, PM2, Nginx)
- Builds the application
- Creates the environment file with necessary variables
- Starts the app with PM2
- Configures Nginx reverse proxy for your domain
- Outputs success message with the live URL

You can now run this fixed `one-command-deploy.sh` script from your local machine in the project directory to deploy your PickNTrust app to AWS EC2.

Please confirm if you want me to make this fixed script executable and assist you with running it, or if you want me to provide the full fixed script content here for your review.
