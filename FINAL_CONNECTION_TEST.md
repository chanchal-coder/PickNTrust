# üö® CRITICAL: Test IP Address First

## The Issue
You keep testing `pickntrust.com` but getting connection refused. However, our server tests show it's working.

## MANDATORY TEST: Use IP Address

**STOP testing pickntrust.com for now.**

**Instead, test this EXACT URL in your browser:**

```
http://51.20.43.157
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Server is confirmed working** - curl tests show HTTP 200 OK
2. **DNS resolves correctly** - nslookup shows correct IP
3. **But you haven't tested the IP directly** in your browser yet

## Step-by-Step Test

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Type exactly**: `http://51.20.43.157`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Tell me what happens**

## Expected Results

If IP works but domain doesn't:
- ‚úÖ **Server is perfect** - deployment complete
- ‚ùå **DNS propagation delay** - wait 1-24 hours
- ‚ùå **Browser DNS cache** - clear cache or try incognito

If IP doesn't work:
- ‚ùå **AWS Security Group issue** - need to fix firewall
- ‚ùå **Service crashed** - need to restart

## Alternative Tests

If browser doesn't work, try:

1. **Different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. **Incognito/Private mode**
3. **Mobile phone browser**
4. **Mobile data** (different network)

## IMPORTANT

**Do NOT test pickntrust.com until the IP address works first!**

The IP address test will tell us if:
- Server is accessible (deployment success)
- Or AWS Security Group is blocking (needs fix)

**Test http://51.20.43.157 now and report the result!**
