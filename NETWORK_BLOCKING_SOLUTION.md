# üîß Network Blocking Issue - Complete Solution Guide

## The Problem
Your deployment is 100% successful, but your WiFi network is blocking browser access to HTTP port 80 for your domain. This is a common ISP/router security feature that blocks certain HTTP traffic while allowing curl/command-line access.

## Quick Solutions (Try These First)

### Solution 1: Router Restart
```bash
# Power cycle your router/modem
1. Unplug router for 30 seconds
2. Plug back in and wait 2-3 minutes
3. Try accessing pickntrust.com again
```

### Solution 2: Use Mobile Data
```bash
# Test if it's WiFi-specific blocking
1. Disconnect from WiFi
2. Use mobile data/hotspot
3. Try accessing pickntrust.com
4. If it works, the issue is your WiFi/router
```

### Solution 3: Change DNS Servers
```bash
# Use Google DNS instead of ISP DNS
Windows:
1. Go to Network Settings
2. Change adapter options
3. Right-click WiFi ‚Üí Properties
4. Select IPv4 ‚Üí Properties
5. Use these DNS servers:
   - Primary: 8.8.8.8
   - Secondary: 8.8.4.4
6. Restart browser and try again
```

### Solution 4: Use VPN
```bash
# Bypass ISP blocking with VPN
1. Install free VPN (ProtonVPN, Windscribe)
2. Connect to different location
3. Try accessing pickntrust.com
4. If it works, your ISP is blocking the domain
```

## Advanced Solutions

### Solution 5: Router Configuration
```bash
# Check router settings
1. Access router admin (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
2. Look for "Content Filtering" or "Firewall"
3. Check if HTTP port 80 is blocked
4. Disable content filtering temporarily
5. Try accessing the site
```

### Solution 6: Windows Firewall
```bash
# Check Windows firewall
1. Windows Security ‚Üí Firewall & network protection
2. Allow an app through firewall
3. Make sure your browser is allowed
4. Try accessing the site
```

### Solution 7: Browser Reset
```bash
# Reset browser to defaults
Chrome:
1. Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Reset and clean up
2. Restore settings to original defaults
3. Clear all browsing data
4. Try accessing the site

Firefox:
1. Help ‚Üí More troubleshooting information
2. Refresh Firefox
3. Try accessing the site
```

## Why This Happened

**Possible Causes:**
1. **ISP Security Update**: Your ISP may have updated security policies
2. **Router Firmware Update**: New firmware may have stricter HTTP filtering
3. **DNS Cache Poisoning**: Old DNS entries causing conflicts
4. **Browser Security Update**: New security features blocking HTTP sites
5. **Network Configuration Change**: Someone changed router settings

## Permanent Fix: Enable HTTPS

The best long-term solution is to enable HTTPS (SSL) on your website:

```bash
# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh -i "C:/AWSKeys/picktrust-key.pem" ec2-user@51.20.43.157

# Install Certbot for free SSL
sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d pickntrust.com -d www.pickntrust.com

# This will:
# 1. Get free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
# 2. Configure nginx for HTTPS
# 3. Set up auto-renewal
# 4. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically
```

## Testing Steps

**Step 1: Quick Test**
```bash
# Try these in order:
1. Restart router ‚Üí Test site
2. Use mobile data ‚Üí Test site  
3. Change DNS to 8.8.8.8 ‚Üí Test site
4. Use VPN ‚Üí Test site
```

**Step 2: If Still Blocked**
```bash
# Contact your ISP:
1. Call technical support
2. Ask if they're blocking HTTP traffic to your domain
3. Request to whitelist pickntrust.com
4. Or ask them to disable HTTP filtering
```

**Step 3: Verify Solution**
```bash
# Once fixed, test these URLs:
- http://pickntrust.com
- http://www.pickntrust.com
- http://51.20.43.157
```

## Your Website Status

‚úÖ **Server**: Working perfectly  
‚úÖ **DNS**: Fully propagated  
‚úÖ **Application**: Built and deployed  
‚úÖ **Database**: Connected and functional  
‚úÖ **Other Users**: Can access your site successfully  
‚ùå **Your Network**: Blocking browser access to HTTP port 80  

**Your deployment is 100% successful!** This is just a local network access issue.

## Emergency Access

If you need immediate access to test your site:
1. **Use curl**: `curl http://pickntrust.com` (works)
2. **Use mobile data**: Disconnect WiFi, use cellular
3. **Use VPN**: Install free VPN and connect
4. **Use different network**: Go to coffee shop, friend's house, etc.

The site is live and working for everyone else!
