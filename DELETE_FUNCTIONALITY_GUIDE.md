## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### ❓ **"I don't see delete buttons"**

**Solution**: Admin mode needs to be enabled
- Delete buttons appear automatically on `localhost`
- For production, ensure admin authentication is working

### ❓ **"Delete button doesn't work"**

**Check these steps**:
1. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console)
2. **Click delete button**
3. **Look for error messages** in console
4. **Check network tab** for failed requests

### ❓ **"Product doesn't disappear"**

**This means**:
- Backend delete succeeded
- Frontend cache invalidation failed
- **Solution**: Refresh the page manually

### ❓ **"Getting 'Delete Failed' errors"**

**Possible causes**:
1. **Product ID format issue** - Check console logs
2. **Network connectivity** - Check if server is running
3. **Authentication issue** - Verify admin password
