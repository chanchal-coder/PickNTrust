# Fix Telegram Bot Privacy Settings

## Issue
The bot is not receiving `channel_post` events from Telegram channels despite being an admin because **Group Privacy is enabled by default** for all Telegram bots.

## Solution
You need to disable Group Privacy for your bot using BotFather:

### Steps:
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Start a chat with BotFather
3. Send `/mybots`
4. Select your bot: `@PickNTrustBot`
5. Click on "Bot Settings"
6. Click on "Group Privacy"
7. Click "Turn Off" to disable Group Privacy

### Important Notes:
- **This change is not automatic**: If the bot is already in channels/groups before turning off privacy mode, you need to:
  - Remove the bot from all channels
  - Add the bot back to all channels as admin
  - OR restart the bot in each channel (if available in channel settings)

### What This Enables:
- Bot will receive ALL messages from channels where it's a member
- Bot will receive ALL messages from groups (not just mentions)
- Bot will be able to process `channel_post` events properly

### Current Bot Token:
`8433200963:AAFE8umMtF23xgE7pBZA6wjIVg-o-2GeEvE`

After making these changes, the bot should start receiving and processing channel messages properly!
