# 🔧 Final PickNTrust Deployment Fix

Great progress! I can see:
- ✅ PM2 is installed and running
- ✅ Nginx is installed and configured
- ✅ Application dependencies are resolved

## 🚨 Final Issue to Fix:

**Problem**: PM2 is looking for `package.json` in `/home/ec2-user/` instead of `/home/ec2-user/PickNTrust/`

**Error**: `Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/ec2-user/package.json'`

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX - Run These Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Stop the current PM2 process
pm2 delete pickntrust

# 2. Navigate to the correct directory
cd /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust

# 3. Start PM2 from the project directory
pm2 start npm --name "pickntrust" -- start

# 4. Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# 5. Check status
pm2 status
```

## 🔧 **Alternative Fix (if above doesn't work):**

```bash
# Stop current process
pm2 delete pickntrust

# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust

# Try starting with specific entry point
if [ -f "dist/server/index.js" ]; then
    pm2 start dist/server/index.js --name "pickntrust"
elif [ -f "server/index.js" ]; then
    pm2 start server/index.js --name "pickntrust"
else
    # Start with npm from correct directory
    pm2 start npm --name "pickntrust" --cwd /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust -- start
fi

pm2 save
```

## 📊 **Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check PM2 status (should show "online")
pm2 status

# Check if app is listening on port 3000
netstat -tlnp | grep 3000

# Test the application locally
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## 🌐 **Expected Results After Fix:**

- **PM2 Status**: `online` (not `errored`)
- **Port 3000**: Should be listening
- **Website**: http://51.20.43.157 should load
- **Admin Panel**: http://51.20.43.157/admin should be accessible

## 🎯 **Quick One-Command Fix:**

```bash
pm2 delete pickntrust && cd /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust && pm2 start npm --name "pickntrust" -- start && pm2 save
```

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check project directory exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust/
   ```

2. **Check package.json exists:**
   ```bash
   cat /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust/package.json
   ```

3. **Try manual start to test:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ec2-user/PickNTrust
   npm start
   ```

4. **Check PM2 logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs pickntrust
   ```

## 🎉 **You're Almost There!**
