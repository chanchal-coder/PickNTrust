Bulbuli — Page Slugs and Display Logic

Overview
- This document lists which page slugs are recognized by the site and explains how pages are rendered on both client and server.
- “Slug” refers to the first URL segment after the domain, e.g. /prime-picks → slug: prime-picks.

How Pages Display
- Client routing: React Router defines explicit routes for known pages plus a dynamic catch‑all `/:slug` route.
- Dynamic pages: The catch‑all route renders `DynamicPage` so admin‑created tabs (new slugs) can display without code changes.
- Widget/page identifier: Components like `PageLayout`/`UniversalPageLayout` map the URL to a page identifier used by widgets and content sections. Special handling:
  - `''` or `home` → `home`
  - `blog/:slug` → `blog` (treated as blog page)
  - `category/*` → `categories` (treated as category page for widgets)
  - Otherwise the first URL segment is used as the page identifier.
- Server API: `server/routes/pages-routes.ts` exposes `GET /api/pages` to list active pages and `GET /api/pages/:pageId` for details.
- Content filtering: Content uses `displayPages` (stored JSON array of slugs) to decide where an item shows. Slugs are normalized to lowercase and `-` separated.
- Banners: Banner endpoints select banners by `page` key; use one of the accepted slugs listed below.

Excluded/Not for targeting (present in routes but excluded from announcement/banners)
- admin
- bot-admin
- how-it-works
- terms-of-service
- privacy-policy
- category (dynamic category pages)

Dynamic Pages
- Any admin-created navigation tab with a unique slug will render via `/:slug` and can host content.
- Unless added to the accepted list above (client `PAGE_METADATA` and server `AVAILABLE_PAGES`), dynamic slugs won’t be returned by `GET /api/pages` and are not used by banner/page-targeted widgets by default.

Source of Truth (code references)
- Client: `client/src/utils/pages.ts` (PAGE_METADATA, EXCLUDED_ROUTES, getAvailablePages)
- Client: `client/src/App.tsx` (explicit routes and `/:slug` dynamic route)
- Client: `client/src/components/PageLayout.tsx` and `client/src/components/UniversalPageLayout.tsx` (page identifier mapping)
- Server: `server/routes/pages-routes.ts` (AVAILABLE_PAGES and `/api/pages`)
- Content: `server/routes/unified-content.ts` (displayPages normalization and storage)

Examples
- To show an item on Home and Prime Picks: set `displayPages` to `["home", "prime-picks"]`.
- To fetch active pages via API: `GET /api/pages` returns the list and metadata.
